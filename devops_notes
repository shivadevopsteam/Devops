How to choose Distro : 

Distro should be chosen based upon user requirement. like 
1-> purpose of use : personal or professional.
2-> easy to install : configuration is done with default values or it is manually chosen?
3-> look and feel : graphical interface or command line interface.

below are some useful Distro examples : 
Ubuntu --> most popular linux distro
            secure and reliable.
            multi-variant releases. ex: destop,server.
            frequent releases.
            easy to use.
            it contains a wide range of softwares like LibreOffice, thunderbird etc. and also games such as suduko and chess.
            
 Fedora --> latest tech having huge support base
            new releases frequently
            easily customizable
            can upgrade versions without reinstalling
            stable and reliable
            easy to use.
            
RHEL - redhat enterprise linux updates for every 12-18 months cycle they will release new commercial.
      - present rehl 8 - stable, support. 
      
Fedora - 6-8 months- non commercial release
         - present version fedora 31 - unstable, no support open source free.

File : 
=======
       -- you dont need a command to check the cpu info, but can print the file "/proc/cpuinfo" like a simple plain text file.
       -- There are some special files that represent hardware devices, system information, etc.
       -- The /proc filesystem in Linux gives detail about the kernels runtime operations in form of plain text files.
       -- file means group of text.
linux commands : 
                  touch filename.txt --> to create one empty file we use touch command followed by filename.
                  touch <filename1.txt>,<filename2.txt>  --> to create more than one.
                  touch < file{1,2,3,4,5,..}.txt > -->to create multiple files in easy way, it creates file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt .....
                  to read created file we can use this cmd --> file file1.txt

                  ls -> list 
                  Ls -l --> l means symbolic link (shortcut to a file/ directory).
                  in output if first letter is d then it is directory.
                  example : if we type LS -L --> then o/p is drwrx-2..(mode of permission)   2    userownership  group ownership   size of file/ directory .
                  
 Types of files in directory : 
                  --> here in o/p if first letter is d then it is normal directory
                                                L then symbolic link ( shortcut to file/document ) 
                                                      we have 2 categories in symbolic link ( soft link and hard link not discussed)
                                                - normal file
                                                S Socket  (pass the data between 2 processes)
                                                P pipe ( similira to Socket but users cannot work direclty)
                                                C processes character hardware communication.
                                                
 --> check the first letter which describes the file type
 --> Based on distro each file type assigned with different color code.                                                
                                                                 
                
Run Level :
==========
1 - Init --> figures out the default run-level to start the associated script with respect to the configured run level.
            we can manually change the run level using the telinit cmd and superuser has permission to modify the run-level
            
2 - It is an operational level which describes the current state of the system with respect to the services available
3 - it is a single digit integer that defines the state of the system.

ex: if it is digit integer 0 - halt the system 
                              1 - single user mode.
                              2 - multiple user mode withno network file system.
                              3 - multiple user mode in CLI, but no GUI
                              4 - User definable
                              5 - multiple user mode in GUI
                              6 - Reboot
                              
        Linux cmd : shutdown -h now   --> this cmd is used to shutdown the linux system
                    shutdown -r now  --> this cmd is used to reboot the system
                    shutdown --help  --> it will show list of options to shutdown like reboot , halt cmds.
                    
                    
 Pipe : 
 ======
 1. pipe represnts as "|" , it is used to direct the o/p of one command to another .
 2. it creates an internal connection between 2 or more cmds.
 3. the data is passed to other cmds directly instead of using temporary text files.
 4. the pipe is unidirectional and data flows from left to right.
 5. Pipe along with grep is most commonly used .
 Ex : cat file.txt | grep "linux"   -----> i.e, cat (reads data from file) file.txt | grep (filter / search) "linux"(searches the word in double quotes).

==== LINUX COMMANDS : ====
pwd - used to standard output the full path name of your current directory (from the root directory).
